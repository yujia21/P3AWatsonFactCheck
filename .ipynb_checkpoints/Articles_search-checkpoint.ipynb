As the Secretary-General of the People's Action Party (PAP), Lee became Prime Minister in August 2004, succeeding Goh Chok Tong. He has been a Member of Parliament (MP) for Teck Ghee since 1984 and a member of the Cabinet since 1987, and was one of the key leaders in Singapore's political transition in the 1980s and 1990s. Before becoming Prime Minister in 2004 he served as the Minister for Trade and Industry, Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minister.

He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in New Delhi, India. Ban was the foreign minister of South Korea from January 2004 to November 2006. In February 2006 he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban was initially considered a long shot for the office. As foreign minister of South Korea, however, he was able to travel to all the countries on the United Nations Security Council, a maneuver that turned him into the campaign's front runner. On 13 October 2006, he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the United Nations General Assembly. On 1 January 2007, he succeeded Kofi Annan. Ban struggled in his first month to adjust to the culture of the United Nations, but quickly found his bearings and passed several major reforms on peacekeeping and UN employment practices.[citation needed] Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on global warming, pressing the issue repeatedly with U.S. President George W. Bush, and on the Darfur conflict, where he helped persuade Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir to allow peacekeeping troops to enter Sudan. Ban was named the world's 32nd most powerful person by the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People in 2013, the highest among South Koreans. In 2014, he was named the third most powerful South Korean after Lee Kun-Hee and Lee Jae-yong.\", [False]]], 'dates': []}\n",

His extensive self promotion, outspoken manner, career, personal life and wealth have made him a celebrity.

Upon graduating from college in 1968 he joined the company, and in 1971 was given control, renaming the company \"The Trump Organization.\" Since then he has built casinos, golf courses, hotels and other properties, many of which bear his name. He has received prominent media exposure and the NBC reality show The Apprentice bolstered his fame. His three marriages were extensively covered in tabloids. He first ran for President of the United States in 2000, winning two Reform Party primaries. On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his decision to run again for President, this time as a Republican. He won the New Hampshire primary with 35% of the vote, the South Carolina primary with 33% and the Nevada caucuses with 46%.
