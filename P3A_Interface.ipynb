manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq.\", ' His official biography states that he speaks both English and French, the two working languages of the UN Secretariat.', ' Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging aid to developing countries were the focus of many news articles.', ' Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were \"groundless\".', ' In an interview on 17 September 2006 he stated: \"As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process\", and that he was \"a man of integrity\".',

peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted.', ' Ban nevertheless pressed ahead with reforms on job requirements at the UN requiring that all positions be considered five-year appointments, all receive

official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions.\", '\" UN records show that South Korea, the organization\\'s eleventh-largest financial contributor,

carried out aggressive investigations into corruption in UN peacekeeping missions from 2006 to 2009.\", ' However, Ahlenius countered in her End of Assignment memo that \"for the Secretary-General to

step of demanding action against North Korea for the alleged sinking of a vessel from his country.', ' Dispatch as being unusual, because it is rare for any Secretary-General—and particularly Ban Ki-moon—to comment on the Security Council taking action on an issue as his office had tended to be extremely deferential to the Security Council.', 'Former UN corruption fighter James Wasserstrom has
